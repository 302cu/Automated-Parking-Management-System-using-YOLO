## Overview
This project leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once) models including YOLOv8 and YOLO-NAS, along with super-gradients, to create a robust automated parking management system. The system is designed to optimize parking space utilization and ensure compliance using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.

## Key Features
- **Car Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for high-speed and accurate vehicle detection.
- **Parking Spot Identification**: Employs YOLO-NAS designed for precise spatial recognition.
- **License Plate Recognition**: Ensures accurate capture of license plate information.
- **Overlap Calculation**: Utilizes algorithms to calculate the overlaps to maximize space and avoid parking violations.

We also feature:
- **Custom Dataset**: Independently developed, using semi-supervised learning for enhanced model training.
- **Super-Gradients**: Applied to improve model training efficiency and effectiveness.

## Installation

**Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/302cu/Automated-Parking-Management-System-using-YOLO.git
```
**Install Dependencies:**
``` bash 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Configuration Setup
- Configure necessary files, including API keys.
- Ensure the Nygak token for server authentication is properly configured.
 ## Web Interface
The system includes a web interface developed in HTML and JavaScript for real-time monitoring and management.

## Usage
The system performs automated tasks to enhance parking management:
- **Detects Cars**: Automatically identifies vehicles entering and leaving.
- **Identifies Parking Spots**: Monitors and assigns available spots.
- **Recognizes License Plates**: Captures and records plate numbers.
- **Calculates Overlaps**: Ensures proper vehicle placement to maximize space.

## Conclusion

The development of the Automated Parking Management System using YOLO models represents a significant advancement in smart parking solutions. By integrating state-of-the-art YOLOv8 and YOLO-NAS models, along with super-gradients, our team has successfully enhanced the efficiency of parking management processes. This system not only automates car detection, parking spot identification, license plate recognition, and overlap calculation but also optimizes the use of space and ensures compliance with parking regulations.

Throughout this project, we have demonstrated the practical application of complex machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. The collaboration among team members Abdullah, Ghada, Dalaa, and Arwa has been pivotal in achieving our goals, each contributing unique expertise to drive the project forward.

Moving forward, we aim to refine this system further, exploring additional functionalities and improving the interface to ensure it remains user-friendly and effective for all stakeholders involved. We believe that continuous improvement and adaptation to new technologies will lead to even more innovative solutions in the field of automated parking management.
